## General info

This project presents website for cinema, based on bootstrap technology, but also used my own solutions.
Site it contains nicely looking hover effect on navbar items, carousel on hero with images and some text.
Below we can find section intended for information about the cinema with collapsing text.
Beneath we can see the screen and seats and movie image we can change image dynamic, and select the seats throught JavaScript.
We can also find the trailers section with button which allows us open the modal with video player.
At the very bottom are placed navigation, contact and newsletter and copyright info.
The project are created by me from scratch using HTML/CSS3/JS.
